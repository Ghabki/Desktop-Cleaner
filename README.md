# Desktop cleaner app
This cleaner app makes it easy to "remove"(it moves all files and directoris to a new folder) files and directories that don't belong on the desktop screen.


# How to use
- Add files and directories to exclude from moving it. (Sadly every new file you create on the desktop screen needs to be manualy added to the exclude list)
- Select if you want the files moved in a new folder or in a folder that was previously used.
- Click clean.

# Warning
